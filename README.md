# Scene classification 

This notebook shows how different neural network architectures perform when it comes to scene classification in three scenarios: 
- fine tuning by updating weights of the whole network and changing the final clssification layer,
- feature extraction by reusing existing features and only changing the final clssification layer and
- model without initial weights.
